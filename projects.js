Photos taken by the rovers were downloaded using API from NASA and were added as posts to each of the rovers' profiles. We also added a text-based game where you play as a rover that just crash landed on Mars. The goal of the game is to find your plutonium before your battery depletes. Out of the 45 teams that submitted projects, we finished in third place. The files for our project can be downloaded at the GitHub page, and instructions to set up and launch the site are included in the ReadMe.",
