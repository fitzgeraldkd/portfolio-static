                I'm Kenny and I'm a full-stack engineer!
                I have a master's degree in architectural engineering and spent about seven years working as a mechanical engineer and project leader at an MEP consulting firm.
                Even though my primary duties were mechanical engineering related, I took every opportunity I could find to hone my skills as a developer as well.
                I was a key member in numerous standards, improvements, and automation tasks.
                <br><br>
                My passion for software engineering led me to pursue this career change and I am currently going through the Flatiron School program.
                After graduating from the course in early January, I am excited to pursue my first career in this industry!

            <!-- I am building this Django web application to give myself a place to document and share the projects I have worked on.
            I am self-taught in programming and am most familiar with Python but have experience in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and SQL as well.
            I also have limited experience in Lua and PHP.
            The projects I've worked on have been opportunities for me to further my understanding of programming while also exploring another topic I'm interested in.

                        This was developed for the Python Discord Summer Code Jam 2020, where I worked with a team of 4 to develop a web app in Django based on the theme "Early Internet."
                        My team decided to build a social media website for the Mars rovers.
                        Photos taken by the rovers were downloaded using API from NASA and were added as posts to each of the rovers' profiles.
                        We also added a text-based game where you play as a rover that just crash landed on Mars.
                        The goal of the game is to find your plutonium before your battery depletes.
                        Out of the 45 teams that submitted projects, we finished in third place.
                        The files for our project can be downloaded at the GitHub page, and instructions to set up and launch the site are included in the ReadMe.
